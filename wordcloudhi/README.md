# For Hindi


``` $pip3 install requirements.txt ```


``` $cd wordcloudhi``` <br>
``` $bash Hindi.sh```

<br> The bash script will run all the codes present here in a methodical way and end after the wordCloud has been displayed.
<br> If on windows, open the bash file in any editor and check out the python commands for the order of execution.
<br> For a custom dataset, input the URLs in the crawl.py to extract data from that website or just run the commands after crawl.py as written in the bash file

<br>**NOTE**
* POS and Lemmatization of Hindi is done using Stanza which can be slow in case of a large dataset.
* POS and Lemmatization for Hindi runs in POSandLemma.py , freq_POS.py and freq_lemma.py
